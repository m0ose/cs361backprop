Cody Smith. 2019


## Usage:
### From the web
This is written in javascript and can be run from the web page https://m0ose.github.io/cs362_neuralNIM/index.html .
### Locally
Download the files to a directory and then open index.html. file->open->[directory]/index.html . Note: that i have only tested this in the Chrome browser.

Most of the code is in main.js or connections.js . Index.html has some User interface code as well.
